# Setup for Development Computers

These are the helpful steps I use to setup my local environment for development.

[Git SCM](https://git-scm.com).

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/):

    $ brew install node
    
For my client/front-end code, install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), with the following extensions:

- Docker
- ESList
- GitLens
- Material Icon Theme
- npm

For my Python applications, install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). This is still better than VSCode for python!
